    "abstract": "Polymarket is a prediction market platform where users can speculate on\nfuture events by trading shares tied to specific outcomes, known as conditions.\nEach market is associated with a set of one or more such conditions. To ensure\nproper market resolution, the condition set must be exhaustive -- collectively\naccounting for all possible outcomes -- and mutually exclusive -- only one\ncondition may resolve as true. Thus, the collective prices of all related\noutcomes should be \\$1, representing a combined probability of 1 of any\noutcome. Despite this design, Polymarket exhibits cases where dependent assets\nare mispriced, allowing for purchasing (or selling) a certain outcome for less\nthan (or more than) \\$1, guaranteeing profit. This phenomenon, known as\narbitrage, could enable sophisticated participants to exploit such\ninconsistencies.\n  In this paper, we conduct an empirical arbitrage analysis on Polymarket data\nto answer three key questions: (Q1) What conditions give rise to arbitrage (Q2)\nDoes arbitrage actually occur on Polymarket and (Q3) Has anyone exploited these\nopportunities. A major challenge in analyzing arbitrage between related markets\nlies in the scalability of comparisons across a large number of markets and\nconditions, with a naive analysis requiring $O(2^{n+m})$ comparisons. To\novercome this, we employ a heuristic-driven reduction strategy based on\ntimeliness, topical similarity, and combinatorial relationships, further\nvalidated by expert input.\n  Our study reveals two distinct forms of arbitrage on Polymarket: Market\nRebalancing Arbitrage, which occurs within a single market or condition, and\nCombinatorial Arbitrage, which spans across multiple markets. We use on-chain\nhistorical order book data to analyze when these types of arbitrage\nopportunities have existed, and when they have been executed by users. We find\na realized estimate of 40 million USD of profit extracted.",

    "abstract": "The efficiency of decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and the influence of token\nrouting algorithms on market performance and stakeholder outcomes remain\nunderexplored. This paper introduces the concept of Standardized Total\nArbitrage Profit (STAP), computed via convex optimization, as a systematic\nmeasure of DEX efficiency. We prove that executing the trade order maximizing\nSTAP and reintegrating the resulting transaction fees eliminates all arbitrage\nopportunities-both cyclic arbitrage within DEXs and between DEXs and\ncentralized exchanges (CEXs). In a fully efficient DEX (i.e., STAP = 0), the\nmonetary value of target tokens received must not exceed that of the source\ntokens, regardless of the routing algorithm. Any violation indicates arbitrage\npotential, making STAP a reliable metric for arbitrage detection. Using a token\ngraph comprising 11 tokens and 18 liquidity pools based on Uniswap V2 data, we\nobserve a decline in DEX efficiency between June 21 and November 8, 2024.\nSimulations comparing two routing algorithms-Yu Zhang et al.'s line-graph-based\nmethod and the depth-first search (DFS) algorithm-show that employing more\nprofitable routing improves DEX efficiency and trader returns over time.\nMoreover, while total value locked (TVL) remains stable with the line-graph\nmethod, it increases under the DFS algorithm, indicating greater aggregate\nbenefits for liquidity providers.",
