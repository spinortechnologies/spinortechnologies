        "<div align=\"center\"> <div align=\"justify\"> We propose a generalization of the classical Sharpe Ratio from modern portfolio theory by replacing its conventional denominator—the standard deviation—with the von Neumann entropy of a density matrix constructed from asset/portfolio correlations. This new metric, termed the Holistic Performance Ratio (HPR), belongs to an emerging class of frontier financial metrics that aim to capture not only statistical dispersion but the internal complexity and relational structure of financial systems. By leveraging concepts from quantum information theory and quantum mechanics, combined with variational optimization and an approach inspired by some thermodynamic principles, this proposal introduces an interpretable risk indicator sensitive to both local and global geometry of portfolios modeled as quantum states. We empirically validate our formulation, showing that HPR offers greater expressiveness in non-stationary and correlated environments, and that it is compatible with hybrid quantum-classical frameworks in a scalable way. A complete implementation and benchmarking against classical approaches alternatives are provided, demonstrating that it outperforms Sharpe by offering deeper insights and correlations while maintaining scalability. </div> </div>\n",

        "Risk measurement in finance has traditionally been addressed within a classical statistical framework, with the Sharpe Ratio being one of the most widely used metrics. However, the limitations of the classical approach—which relies solely on variance—become evident in markets characterized by complex dynamics, variable correlations, and nonlinear structures.\n",
        "\n",
        "This work proposes a generalization of the Sharpe Ratio through concepts from quantum mechanics and information theory, using the von Neumann entropy as a measure of structural risk. The proposal builds on a functional analogy between the correlation structure of assets and mixed quantum states, allowing risk assessment from a richer perspective with greater informational content.\n",

        "While the Sharpe ratio exhibits noticeable fluctuations in response to changes in volatility and performance, the Holistic Performance Ratio (HPR)—driven by the von Neumann entropy of the density matrix derived from asset correlations—remains almost constant and close to zero across time with this strategy and this synthetic beta.\n",
        "\n",
        "This flat behavior of HPR suggests that the structural complexity or disorder of the asset space, as captured by quantum entropy, does not vary significantly under this simple VWAP strategy. Consequently, the entropy-normalized excess return stays low even when cumulative performance or Sharpe may rise.\n",
        "\n",
        "This imply two things:\n",
        "\n",
        "The strategy does not fundamentally alter the inter-asset structure (correlation network remains stable), leading to flat entropy.\n",
        "\n",
        "The numerator (excess return) remains small relative to entropy, reinforcing that optimization in signal does not translate to a reorganization of the portfolio’s informational structure.\n",
        "\n",
        "The empirical $\\rho$ matrices showed stable spectral distributions, i.e., their eigenvalues (which determine entropy) varied only minimally across time. This implies that:\n",
        "\n",
        "The inter-asset correlation topology remained largely unchanged.\n",
        "\n",
        "There was no structural rotation, entanglement shift, or reconfiguration of latent portfolio geometry.\n",
        "\n",
        "Therefore, strategies that modify asset interactions (e.g., adaptive weights, hedging, or regime switching) may better express HPR’s potential compared to signal-only filters like VWAP."
